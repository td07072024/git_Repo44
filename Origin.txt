The Ghaghara River, also known as the Karnali River in Nepal, Mapcha Tsangpo in Tibet, and the lower Ghaghara in Awadh is known as the Sarayu River,[1] is a perennial trans-boundary river that originates in the northern slopes of the Himalayas in the Tibetan Plateau, cuts through the Himalayas in Nepal and joins the Sharda River at Brahmaghat in India. Together they form the Ghaghara River, a major left-bank tributary of the Ganges. With a length of 507 km (315 mi), it is the longest river in Nepal. The total length of the Ghaghara up to its confluence with the Ganges at Revelganj in Bihar is 1,080 km (670 mi).[2] It is the largest tributary of the Ganges by volume and the second largest by length after Yamuna.
